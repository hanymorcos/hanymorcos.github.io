## TL;DR

- ðŸŒ³ We'll talk about how to use an NPM to connect our site to Google Analytics

---

I spent a long time determinning the correct approach to add my site to google analytics. Google only provides
a javascript snippet to add to your header menu. I didn't like the approach, it didn't go nicely with hour my
website was implemented. After doing some research and read few github chats and issues, I stumpled on a Node
package that I could use for my site. 

The package is called analytics, by Davide Wells. https://github.com/DavidWells/analytics . The packge provides a hook, use-analtyics as a separate package,
which I used to wrap my Components tag in _app.tsx. 


The final code ðŸ˜Ž:
```typescript
import googleAnalytics from '@analytics/google-analytics'
import { Analytics } from 'analytics'
import { AnalyticsProvider, useAnalytics } from 'use-analytics'

/* Initialize analytics & load plugins */
const analytics = Analytics({
  app: 'awesome-app',
  plugins: [
    googleAnalytics({
      measurementIds: ['<YOUR Analytics Profile ID>'],
    }),
  ],
})

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <AnalyticsProvider instance={analytics}>
     <div id="outer-container">
          <Nav />
          <Menubar />
          <div id="page-wrap">
            <Component {...pageProps} />
            <Footer />
          </div>
        </div>
    </AnalyticsProvider>
    )
    };
```
